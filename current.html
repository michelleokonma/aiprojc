				<h3>Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h3>
				<p>Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on training algorithms to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. It includes supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning techniques.</p>
				<p>Deep learning is a specialized branch of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to model and understand complex patterns in large datasets. It powers many modern AI applications such as image and speech recognition.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
				<p>Language Models is advanced models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's BERT are capable of understanding and generating human language, enabling applications in chatbots, translation, and content creation.</p>
				<p>Text Analysis is tools for sentiment analysis, summarization, and information retrieval that enhance business intelligence and customer service.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Computer Vision</h3>
				<p>AI systems can analyze and interpret visual data, enabling applications like facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, and medical imaging.</p>
				<p>Object Detection and Recognition is used in various sectors from security to retail for identifying and classifying objects within images or videos.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Robotics and Automation</h3>
				<p>Autonomous Systems are AI-driven robots and drones capable of performing tasks without human intervention, used in manufacturing, logistics, and exploration.</p>
				<p>Process Automation is Robotic Process Automation (RPA) that uses AI to automate repetitive tasks, improving efficiency and reducing human error in business processes.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Generative AI</h3>
				<p>Content Creation are AI models that can generate text, images, music, and even code, assisting in creative industries and software development.</p>
				<p>Synthetic Media are Tools for creating realistic synthetic images, videos, and voices, used in entertainment, marketing, and more.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Ethical and Explainable AI</h3>
				<p>Bias Mitigation are ongoing efforts to identify and reduce biases in AI systems to ensure fairness and equity.</p>
				<p>Explainability is developing methods to make AI decision-making processes more transparent and understandable to humans.</p>
